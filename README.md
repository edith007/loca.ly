# Loca.ly

#### From specifications:
In this project, you’ll build an online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. Users will be able to sign into your site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time. Finally, you’ll add a personal touch to your chat application of your choosing!
